    abstract = {Log anomaly detection, which focuses on detecting anomalous log records, becomes an active research problem because of its importance in developing stable and sustainable systems. Currently, many unsupervised log anomaly detection approaches are developed to address the challenge of limited anomalous samples. However, collecting enough data to train an unsupervised model is not practical when the system is newly deployed online. To tackle this challenge, we propose a transferable log anomaly detection (LogTAD) framework that leverages the adversarial domain adaptation technique to make log data from different systems have a similar distribution so that the detection model is able to detect anomalies from multiple systems. Experimental results show that LogTAD can achieve high accuracy on cross-system anomaly detection by using a small number of logs from the new system.},
